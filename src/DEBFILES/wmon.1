.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwmon\fP is a wireless network monitor that generates metrics of packet loss and network utilization based on the delays and losses of the beacons packets sent by the acces points.

It also provides other information such as the received signal strength indication (RSSI), the security (i.e. WEP, WPA or WPA2 protected network), the BSSID of the access point, the SSID and channel of every network.

The program has an easy interactive interface that is able to show metrics and sort information for some criteria.

The program can export the calculated metrics to a CSV file, so they can be analyzed externally.
